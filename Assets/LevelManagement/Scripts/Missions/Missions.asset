    _description: The lava lands. Once forsaken by the Revengers, these cursed lands
      have never again seen the light of day. In the day the Broken King layed his
      hands on the Goblet of Uldrith, only the light of the pouring magma from every
      inch of the ground would be cast upon the scorched, deteriorated face of this
      country. Survival may be quite impossible, unless the mix of experience and
      sheer luck is on your side.
